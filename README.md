# Company_Bankruptcy_Prediction
Due to the capabilities of todayâ€™s technology, business managers have the op-
tion to leverage the data they collect to optimize their business operations and
decisions. A very important factor for the success of a business is its financial
health, therefore it is of critical importance that a business manager has high
quality information regarding the financial course of their business. The purpose
of this work is to analyze financial indicators as well as other information from a
series of data of Greek companies, so as to successfully predict the bankruptcy
or non-bankruptcy of a company. Therefore, a model will be created which,
taking as input the appropriate data, will be able to direct business managers
to prevent the bankruptcy of their business.
Data preprocessing will be performed and model architectures such as Lo-
gistic Regression, Decision Trees, k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Ma-
chines, Naive Bayes, Linear Discriminant Analysis and Multi-Layer Perceptrons
will be compared. The results will be evaluated mainly based on the metrics spe-
cificity, i.e. how many companies are correctly predicted as bankrupt and recall,
i.e. how many companies are correctly predicted as non-bankrupt, other classi-
fication evaluation metrics will also be calculated, such as F1-Score, Accuracy
and Precision so as to create a comprehensive evaluation for each classifier.
